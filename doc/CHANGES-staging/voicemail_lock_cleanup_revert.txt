Subject: app_voicemail

A feature was added in Asterisk 13.27.0 and 16.4.0 that removed lock files from
the Asterisk voicemail directory on startup. Some users that store their
voicemails on network storage devices experienced slow startup times due to the
relative expense of traversing the voicemail directory structure looking for
orphaned lock files. This feature has now been removed.

Users who require the lock files to be removed at startup should modify their
startup scripts to do so before starting the asterisk process.
