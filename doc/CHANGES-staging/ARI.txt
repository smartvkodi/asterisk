Subject: ARI Channels

The Channel resource has a new sub-resource "externalMedia".
This allows an application to create a channel for the sole purpose
of exchanging media with an external server.  Once created, this
channel could be placed into a bridge with existing channels to
allow the external server to inject audio into the bridge or
receive audio from the bridge.

for more information.
