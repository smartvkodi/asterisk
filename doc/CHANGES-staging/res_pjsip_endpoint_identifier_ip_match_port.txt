Subject: res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip

In 'type = identify' sections, the addresses specified for the 'match'
clause can now include a port number. For IP addresses, the port is
provided by including a colon after the address, followed by the
desired port number. If supplied, the netmask should follow the port
number. To specify a port for IPv6 addresses, the address itself must
be enclosed in brackets to be parsed correctly.
