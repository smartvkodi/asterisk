Subject: chan_rtp

The UnicastRTP channel driver provided by chan_rtp now accepts
"<hostname>:<port>" as an alternative to "<ip_address>:<port>" in the destination.
The first AAAA (preferred) or A record resolved will be used as the destination.
The lookup is synchronous so beware of possible dialplan delays if you specify a
hostname.
