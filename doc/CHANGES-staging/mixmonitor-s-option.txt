Subject: app_mixmonitor

An option 'S' has been added to MixMonitor. If used in combination with
the r() and/or t() options, if a frame is available to write to one of
those files but not the other, a frame of silence if written to the file
that does not have an audio frame. This should prevent the two files
from "drifting" when mixed after the fact.
