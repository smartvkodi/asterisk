Subject: taskprocessor.c

Added two new CLI commands to reset stats for taskprocessors. You can
reset stats for a single, specific taskprocessor ('core reset
taskprocessor <taskprocessor>'), or you can reset all taskprocessors
('core reset taskprocessors'). These commands will reset the counter for
the number of tasks processed as well as the max queue size.
