Subject: func_jitterbuffer

The JITTERBUFFER dialplan function now has an option to enable video synchronization
support. When enabled and used with a compatible channel driver (chan_sip, chan_pjsip)
the video is buffered according to the size of the audio jitterbuffer and is
synchronized to the audio.
